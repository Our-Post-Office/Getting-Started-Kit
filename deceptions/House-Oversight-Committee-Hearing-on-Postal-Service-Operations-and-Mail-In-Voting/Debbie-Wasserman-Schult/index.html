    <h2>Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy Transcript</h2>
<section>
    <h3>Chairwoman Maloney</h3>
    <p>The gentleman yields back.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Chairwoman Maloney</h3>
    <p>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz is now recognized.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Thank you madam chair. Mr. DeJoy, the culture and ethos of the US Postal Service is every piece everyday. I've been in briefings with Florida's local postal service employees who are telling me that since your arrival this is no longer the mission of the USPS.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Overtime to finish delivering mail is not allowed and piles upon piles of backlog mail are being left undelivered. Sorting machines are being sold for scrap or unplugged and roped off.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>My first question is it still the policy and goal of the USPS to deliver every piece everyday or have you eliminated or changed that in anyway?</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster General DeJoy</h3>
    <p>Uh, first of all that is misrepresentation of any action that I have taken but yes the goal is to get to deliver every piece every day and ma'am we were not doing that before I got here my goal is to...</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Okay. Well, it's gotten. I'm reclaiming my time. It has clearly gotten worse since your arrival we have piles upon piles of mail that as a result of the changes that you've made appear to have delayed the mail even further than supposedly they were delayed previously.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>Change.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Your-- No.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>Change, I've made.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Well, the changes that you've made.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>Change, I made one change.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Well, I'm sorry. You've made far more that one change.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>That's not true.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Okay. I'm reclaiming my time. You're not being honest with this committee.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>That's not true. I am being honest.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Okay. I would ask the chair add time back and direct the witness not inturupt me.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Ranking Member Comer</h3>
    <p>Madame Chair. (As Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz talks): Let's allow the witness to answer the question to the false accusation.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Mr. DeJoy. I'm sorry, re re reclaiming my- reclaiming my time. I did not interrupt any other member while they were talking and I expect not to be interrupted. The time is mine.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Mr. DeJoy, you are not being honest without, without with the committee about removing the sorting machines. We have been asking you for details for weeks. And you have been hiding them from us while removing them at a breakneck pace.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>On August 4th your staff gave this committee a briefing on this issue and all they told was that you'd be moving machines around to where they were needed most. We have the slides from that briefing. There was no mention of taking any sorting machines offline.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>On August 11th, your general counsel responded to our request for more information with no mention of taking any sorting machines offline.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Your culture of misinformation has even trickeled down to Florida Postal Leadership on August 14th my office asked whether sorting machines were being removed at the Royal Palm facility which covers all of South Florida. And were assured that the capacity was being expanded.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>But it was only after I spoke with local postal workers that I was told about the FSS machine in Royal Palm which been shut down and ropped off since July. Press outlets finally revealed the internal plan to remove more that six hundred plus sorting machines you were not transparent we had to get it from news reports.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>I want to take this opportunity to enter into the record Madame Chair an August 18th 2020 email from USPS Director of maintenance operations Kevin Couch. Madame Chair?</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>The email reads: "Please message out to your respective maintenance managers tonight they are not to reconnect, reinstall machines that have previously been disconnected without approval from headquarters maintenance no matter what direction they are getting from their plant manager."</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Mr. DeJoy, yes or no? And you you've indicated in this committee hearing that it's not your job to decide about whether sorting machines are on or offline but at the same time you told Mr. Khanna that you won't bring them online because they're not needed. So yes or no have any plant managers requested mail sorting machines be reconnected?</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>First of all,</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz (Interrupting)</h3>
    <p>Yes or now.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>I disagree with the premise.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz (Interrupting)</h3>
    <p>I'm not asking you anything other than. I'm reclaiming my time Madame Chair. Yes or no.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Maloney</h3>
    <p>Yes or no answer.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Yes or no? Have any plant managers across the country in the USPS requested mail sorting machines be reconnected?</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>How would I. I. How would I know that?</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>You're in charge. You don't know whether there are there are plant managers that have requested. Well let me just.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>No, I don't know.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Let me just assure you that there are plant managers. That was reported in the press. In both Washington. I, I, I. It, there are plant managers in Texas and Washington and I have articles, too, that I can show you that have asked to have sorting machines reconnected and brought back online. And they've been too scared to come forward to say so.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>So you've indicated that it's local leadership in this hearing I heard you say it's not your job to decide whether sorting machines are brought online or not (someone is talking over). Someone needs to mute madam chair. Madame chair, someone needs to mute.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Maloney</h3>
    <p>People who are listening, please mute.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>I probably. I need probably about thirty seconds from the interuptions added back on to my time please.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>You have said in this hearing it's both not your job to make decisions about sorting machines and at the same time you've said that you're not going to bring them back online because they're not needed.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>It can't be both. So. My local. My local bar code. My local handlers who work with sorting machines regularly and this specific bar code sorter machine have assured me that it would not be difficult to plug it back in.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>How difficult would it be to reconnect machines that haven't already destroyed. For example on display. If we can bring that up on the screen. I was sent a photo from a processing and distribution center in Florida where the power cord is hanging from the ceiling and not plugged in. And my local handlers tell me that the sorting machines regularly. And that specific machine, specifically that it would not be difficult to plug it back in.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Do you believe that it is the local handers job to decide whether they need a sorting machine and will you give them the freedom to plug the machines back in and bring the machines that haven't been taken apart back online in order to make sure we can get the mail out on time which you acknowledge has gotten worse since your arrival.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Maloney</h3>
    <p>The gentlewomen's time has expired but the gentleman is requested to answer a question.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>That was a long list of accusations. That are not. That are not. Well its my time now? Is it my time to answer?</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz (Taking over)</h3>
    <p>No, I just want a simple answer to the question about whether you will give. No, it's always my time. And I'd like an answer to the question.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Ranking Member Comer</h3>
    <p>Her time is expired.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>I'm sorry. I'd like an answer to the question whether on not...</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>We have a management team that management team that is responsible for making decisions as to what, what, what machines are used and not used.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>But those things are decided locally. Will you let them decide it locally. Yes or no? Will you let them decide that locally.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Ranking Member Comer (Talking over Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz)</h3>
    <p>Time is expired.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Postmaster DeJoy</h3>
    <p>No.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz</h3>
    <p>Okay. Well than you have not told us the truth in this hearing. And it is your fault has been late. Your fault. On you and you have acknowledged that. I yield back the balance of my time.</p>

</section><section>
    <h3>Ranking Member Comer (Interrupting Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz over and over)</h3>
    <p>Time has expired. Madame Chairwoman, her time has expired. Her time is expired. Her time has expired. Her time has expired.</p>
