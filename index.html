            <h2>Purposes For Being Here</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To protect the United States Postal Service from being subverted</li>
                <li>To support the post office in being as effective as possible</li>
                <li>To support Democracy by mail</li>
                <li>To support those who are working to advance shared purposes</li>
                <li>To support citizens in becoming informed about the current state of Public Postage in the USA</li>
                <li>To get information out to everyone</li>
                <li>To actively practice and increase Democracy</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How we will build a decentralized movement to save the post office</h2>
            <p>This website is a seed. You can literally <a href="https://github.com/Our-Post-Office/Getting-Started-Kit"/>fork it on Github</a> and make your own just like it. You can change anything you like. It can become your site, too. I plan to make videos of how to. Eventually, I will also make the site more modular and interchangeable to increase the effectiveness of our participation.</p>

            <h2>Sovereign Solidarity: Activism for our time</h2>
            <p>We live in a time of incredible individuality. Federation alone will not save us. We cannot just organize top down even if the top is democratic. Many people want to do something, but don't want to be just one person in a crowd. Not only that, but we are also facing a full on pandemic with COVID. If we support individuals making their own personal campaigns for issues they are passionate about where they are working from their deepest truth, I believe we have a much greater chance at creating the kind of passion that will transform the world.</p>
            <p>I am supporting other people's sovereign campaigns. A sovereign campaign is a campaign where one person totally owns the campaign. I can support your campaign and you can support mine if we agree enough that we feel like we are advancing things together toward our goals. If we ever feel like we are getting in each other's way, we can choose to help others' instead. This makes it easy for everyone to keep working while having a campaign they truly believe in. It also makes it so that we can work together effectively while never needing to slow down. We also now each have our own lab which we can use to find out what works through experimentation.</p>
            <p>If I support somone in becoming their own sovereign activist, we can also both share in helping other people become sovereign activists. This is how we are going to make it spread. It's not such a job. It involves supporting people at making a website, supporting people making signs, supporting people at hosting online events, helping sovereigns study how effectively they help people. Many of the things others use will be almost the same as what I use. With the tools we have, I can help someone get their own site up in a half hour. It's not so hard to teach them how to make their changes to the site either. If they see that what they are doing is building something that shall be with them for a long time, they are more invested.</p>

            <h2>Get Support</h2>
            <p>I am willing to be supportive of people who share at least some of the same purposes that I have. I currently have capacity to help more people.</p>
            <p><a href="mailto:info@OurPostOffice.org">Email me at info@OurPostOffice.org</a> and you are looking for support</p>
            <h3>Here are some ways I can be supportive:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Help you get your site up</li>
                <li>Help you improve your street activism</li>
                <li>Help you be more effective</li>
                <li>Help you help others be more effective</li>
                <li>Help you get informed</li>
                <li>Help you help others get informed</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How I must prioritize my time</h3>
            <p>Although I currently have time to help more people, I still have to prioritize my time. Here's what matters to me if I use my time to be supportive of others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To work with others who are pursuing at least one shared objective</li>
                <li>By working with those willing to empathetically make space for the innate dignity of all people</li>
                <li>That we are committed to learning which means testing what works and fails</li>
                <li>That we abandon any collaboration where we witness corruption</li>
                <li>That we do whatever it takes to keep everyone involved safe from the pandemic</li>
                <li>That we are supportive of the development of others rather than using rewards and punishments to manipulate them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How do I measure success?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How soon the USPS sorting machines are all back in operation</li>
                <li>That we find out what brings people to the post office</li>
                <li>The rate of how often the USPS does what matters to those it serves</li>
                <li>How often postal consumers have to come back again to get what matters to them</li>
                <li>The rate at which we help become more informed</li>
                
            </ul>
