            <h2>Purposes For Being Here</h2>

                <li>To protect the United States Postal Service from being subverted</li>
                <li>To support the post office in being as effective as possible</li>
                <li>To support Democracy by mail</li>
                <li>To support those who are working to advance shared purposes</li>
                <li>To support citizens in becoming informed about the current state of Public Postage in the USA</li>

            <h2>How we will build a decentralized movement to save the post office</h2>
            <p>This website is a seed. You can literally <a href="https://github.com/Our-Post-Office/Getting-Started-Kit"/>fork it on Github</a> and make your own just like it. You can change anything you like. It can become your site, too. I plan to make videos of how to. Eventually, I will also make the site more modular and interchangeable to increase the effectiveness of our participation.</p>

            <h2>Help us improve</h2>
            <p>If you have ideas for how we can improve, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Our-Post-Office/Getting-Started-Kit/issues">share them on our Github issues page.</a></p>
            <h2>Get Support</h2>
            <p>I am willing to be supportive of people who share at least some of the same purposes that I have. I currently have capacity to help more people.</p>
            <p><a href="mailto:info@OurPostOffice.org">Email me at info@OurPostOffice.org</a> and you are looking for support</p>
            <h3>Here are some ways I can be supportive:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Help you get your site up</li>
                <li>Help you improve your street activism</li>
                <li>Help you be more effective</li>
                <li>Help you help others be more effective</li>
                <li>Help you get informed</li>
                <li>Help you help others get informed</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How I must prioritize my time</h3>
            <p>Although I currently have time to help more people, I still have to prioritize my time. Here's what matters to me if I use my time to be supportive of others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To work with others who are pursuing at least one shared objective</li>
                <li>By working with those willing to empathetically make space for the innate dignity of all people</li>
                <li>That we are committed to learning which means testing what works and fails</li>
                <li>That we abandon any collaboration where we witness corruption</li>
                <li>That we do whatever it takes to keep everyone involved safe from the pandemic</li>
                <li>That we are supportive of the development of others rather than using rewards and punishments to manipulate them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How do I measure success?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How soon the USPS sorting machines are all back in operation</li>
                <li>That we find out what brings people to the post office</li>
                <li>The rate of how often the USPS does what matters to those it serves</li>
                <li>How often postal consumers have to come back again to get what matters to them</li>
                <li>The rate at which we help become more informed</li>
                
            </ul>

            <h2>Sign ideas</h2>

            <h2>Ways you can be supportive</h2>
            <p>Before I even tell you what I think could be of help, maybe you have an idea of your own? Feel free to email me about it. Here are the kinds of things I could use some help on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helping us design useful materials such as signs, buttons, tutorials, shirts or anything that helps us get the news out there.</li>
